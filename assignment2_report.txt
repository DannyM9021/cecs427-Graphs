    This time around, I felt like I had a better grasp of the assignment since it was just building up from the last assignment. However, there were still some things that
I was having trouble with. The way I approached this lab was by, first of all, reading the instructions on what needed to be implemented for this assignment (as some of the
implementation were already done from the previous assignment). I started by updating the options menu and then creating a function for each of the new requirements that were
listed. Then to actually implement each of the functions, I looked to the Networkx documentation to see if they already had a partial or even complete implementation of what 
was being asked, that way I could avoid making simple mistakes in some of the algorithms. I noticed that Networkx did have mostly everything that I needed, I just needed to 
read the documentation of that certain function to know what the parameters of that function was and what the return type was, so I can later use the results for output and
graphing purposes.
    Some difficulties I was having was choosing the "correct" functions from Networkx. As mentioned, most of the implementation was done by Networkx, but I needed to check 
which functions specifically would work for my specific use case. Some functions were very similar, but at the end of the day I chose the easiest to implement, and the one
that seemed to have the best compatibility for this assignment. However, most of the frustration came from the error messages that were produced by functions provided
by Networkx. Some of the messages were very vague and I needed to look at outside resources such as StackOverflow to see how to fix the error. However, it seems that not 
many people had the issues I was facing, so if I couldn't find the answer, I had to go back to my code and analyze line by line (sometimes adding print statements for debugging,
really bad way of doing it, but it was working) and see what the error was. If I still couldn't find out why it wasn't working, I felt like it may not be useful for my use case,
so I would choose a similar function that fulfills almost the same thing, but with more of my implementation. Final alternative, was to implement that function manually (which didn't
happen very often).
    I did not need to implement many extra features other than the one's that were outlined in the instructions. I did have to modify some of the previous assignment's functions as now
we also needed to enable and disable some of the functions to allow the user to choose whether to enable a certain function (such as enabling the cluster coefficient when graphing). All
in all, I do believe that this assignment was a bit easier than the first time as I already knew what to expect and I had a better idea of how to implement some of the functions. I also 
knew that I had tools that I can use such as the Networkx library and documentaion, StackOverflow, and YouTube to help me understand how to implement and how to solve the problems.
