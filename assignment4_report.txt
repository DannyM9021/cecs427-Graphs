  For this assignment, I felt a bit more confident to what I was doing. I was able to (hopefully) implement everything correctly.
I started by reviewing the class lecture notes I took to understand the Market Clearance Algorithm again, and once I got the general 
idea, I started the assignment. I began to finish the tasks that were easiest to implement, such as "Create Bigraph", "Perfect Match",
"Plot Bigraph", etc since most of those already had some implementation done by networkx. Once those were finished I implemented the 
Market Clearing Algorithm as well as plotting.
  The most difficult part of the assignment in my opinion was the Market Clearning algorithm. For one, there wasn't really a networkx
function that helped me figure that part out. The other thing that was quite difficult was, that I understood how the algorithm worked
and knew the general idea, however, it was a bit difficult to translate that into code. I really don't think my code is optimized, however,
it got the job done, altough, I did end up using a bunch of loops and lists to get it done. I do thing there is a bit of a problem with the way
I implemented, where sometimes since two houses have the same profit, it usually takes the 1st option even though that was is already taken, thus
adding another step to the algorithm. Despite, that I do believe that the matching is correct and successfully "makes all buyers and sellers happy".
  No additional features were implemented. I tried to implement most of what was asked to the best of my abilities. Thanks to the extension, I was
able to get it successfully done. If not, I would have probably turned in this assignment very late, so thank you very much for the extension.
